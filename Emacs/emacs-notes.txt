Emacs is not merely a text editor but almost a complete operating system. 

Emacs helps you be productive by providing an integrated environment for many
different kinds of tasks:

 >> All of the basic editing commands (and there are lots of them) are available no
matter what you're trying to do: write code, read a manual, use a shell, or
compose an email.
 >> All the tools Emacs provides for opening, saving, searching, and processing text
(and more) are available to you no matter what you're doing.j
